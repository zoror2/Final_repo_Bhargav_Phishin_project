# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Should match the dark theme with cyan/green accents
- **Design**: Shield or security-related symbol recommended

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Online icon generators
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Icon libraries (Material Icons, FontAwesome)

## Placeholder Icons

For development, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images.
The extension will work without these icons, but they improve the user experience.

## Icon Guidelines

- Keep designs simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast for visibility
- Ensure the icon represents security/phishing protection
- Test visibility in both light and dark browser themes
